## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the required packages and print the present data.
2. Find the null and duplicate values.
3. Using logistic regression find the predicted values of accuracy , confusion matrices.
4. Display the results.
